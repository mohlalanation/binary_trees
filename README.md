Where root is a double pointer to the root node of heap
Your function must return the value stored in the root node
The root node must be freed and replace with the last level-order node of the heap
Once replaced, the heap must be rebuilt if necessary
If your function fails, return 0

⬜ 40. Heap - Sort
Write a function that converts a Binary Max Heap to a sorted array of integers

Prototype: int *heap_to_sorted_array(heap_t *heap, size_t *size);
Where heap is a pointer to the root node of the heap to convert
And size is an address to store the size of the array
You can assume size is a valid address
Since we are using Max Heap, the returned array must be sorted in descending order

⬜ 41. Big O #Binary Heap
What are the average time complexities of those operations on a Binary Heap (one answer per line):

Inserting the value n
Extracting the root node
Searching for a node in a binary heap of size n
